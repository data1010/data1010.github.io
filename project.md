## Project


This course includes one project, which will be due on Tuesday, November 21st at midnight. You will create your project as a blog post and submit it via URL.

### Content

Your blog post will be an explainer for one idea which is adjacent to DATA 1010 topic sequence. Here are some ideas:

* Applications of SVD
  - Image processing
  - [Genomic data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC27718/pdf/pq010101.pdf)
* An application of a matrix decomposition in numerical linear algebra (see [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Introduction-Undergraduate/dp/3319742213), for example).
* Constrained optimization and the [KKT conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush–Kuhn–Tucker_conditions)
* Gradient Descent Algorithms
  - [BFGS optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno_algorithm) (and [L-BFGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS))
  - [Conjugate Gradient Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method)
* The [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) PRNG
* Random matrices and [Wigner's semicircle law](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/WignersSemicircleLaw.html)
* Common distributions and their applications (other than the ones we did in class)
  - Hypergeometric distribution
  - Benford's law
  - Cauchy distribution
  - [Etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions)
* Applications of bootstrapping
* Maximum likelihood estimation and Fisher information
* Hypothesis testing in studies on a particular topic (e.g, [mask-wearing and COVID-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8)). In other words, explain the hypothesis tests being used in some of the relevant studies in a way that would be comprehensible to someone just beginning to learn about hypothesis tests.
* No-free-lunch theorem: [is it valuable?](https://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.com/2019/07/dont-cite-no-free-lunch-theorem.html)

These topics are just ideas; you're welcome (and encouraged) to choose your own topic. You can look at the free book [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io) for lots more ideas. Feel free to ask on Piazza to get feedback about any particular ideas you might be considering. We will also add to the list above as the term progresses.

When you have chosen a topic, please write a few sentences to describe it and outline a plan for exposition. Submit [here](https://tables.area120.google.com/form/amlo-H8XFYF9iU8LSg7Ozr/t/9qULWAPRcFA5ZmCk7oFO6lah9diK4hiFVe2mabjAa_NL8irLP6Kd1gQ0Nv02ZnuOk_). All submissions should be received by November 6th at the latest.

### Blogging

Here are some options for blog hosting:

1. **Medium**. The go-to option for this sort of thing. It has a clean, beautiful writing interface. One major disadvantage is that it doesn't directly support mathematical typesetting. So you're going to have to explore options which involve generating images and including them that way (which can be annoying when you want to edit). You can also use the [Math Anywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/math-anywhere/gebhifiddmaaeecbaiemfpejghjdjmhc?hl=en) Chrome extension (which is going to be less work, but it means someone has to install that extension to read your article). If you take the latter option, add a note at the beginning of the article with instructions for downloading the extension.
2. **FastPages**. From FastAI, [this option](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) allows you to author content in Jupyter notebook format (or .docx, or Markdown) and have it automatically deployed via GitHub to a blog hosted on a GitHub page. They've done the work of getting all the workflows organized, so all you have to do is a few initial setup steps and then upload your Jupyter Notebook to a specific directory in your repo. Check out [this video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0boq3zqazI) to see how it all works.
